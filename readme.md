## Soooo, what is it?
It's a theme for [Grav](http://getgrav.org) that I use for my blog [Sequence Break](http://sqncbrk.com). Fonts are missing from the repo, graphics are embedded in SASS for the most part. It needs a special plugin for [bLazy](https://github.com/dinbror/blazy) to work. Its code is awful. I need to rewrite it.
Also I need to fix the fuckton of things. And make a new layout. Also a bagel.
