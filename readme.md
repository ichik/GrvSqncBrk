## So what do I have?
* A [fully working](https://github.com/ichik/SqncBrk) HTML, CSS and JS combo as a theme prototype. Yes it really works even on real devices.
* A very basic knowledge of said technologies
* An even more limited knowledge of PHP and Twig

## And what do I need to do
* A working theme for [Grav](http://getgrav.org)
* Most probably a plugin for “load more” functionality too
